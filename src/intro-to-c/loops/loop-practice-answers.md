@. Create a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 50 inclusive. (You must use a loop.)

  **Possible Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++)
    {
      if (i % 2 == 0)
      {
        printf("%d\n", i);
      }
    }
    return 0;
  }
  ```

  **Another Possible Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    for (int i = 2; i <= 50; i += 2)
    {
      printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. Create a program that prints the first 33 multiples of 3. (3, 6, 9, 12, ..., 99)

  **Possible Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < 33; i++)
    {
      printf("%d\n", (i + 1) * 3);
    }

    return 0;
  }
  ```

  **Another Possible Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 33; i++)
    {
      printf("%d\n", i * 3);
    }

    return 0;
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. Create a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 inclusive, except for numbers evenly divisible by 5.

  **Sample Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
    {
      // Skip over all numbers evenly divisible by 5
      if (i % 5 == 0)
      {
        continue;
      }

      printf("%d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. Create a program that prints all multiples of 8 between 8 and 148 inclusive, except for numbers evenly divisible by 3. (8, 16, 32, 40, 56, ...)

  **Possible Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    for (int i = 8; i <= 148; i = i + 8)
    {
      // If i isn't evenly divisible by 3, print it
      if (i % 3 != 0)
      {
        printf("%d\n", i);
      }
    }

    return 0;
  }
  ```

  **Another Possible Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    int i = 8;

    while (i <= 148)
    {
      // If i isn't evenly divisible by 3, print it
      if (i % 3 != 0)
      {
        printf("%d\n", i);
      }

      i = i + 8;
    }

    return 0;
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. How many times will the following loop run? (Hint: Don't try to run it)

  ``` c
  void the_coolest_loop(void)
  {
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i--)
    {
      printf("i is %d!\n", i);
    }
  }
  ```

  **Answer**: This is an infinite loop! `i` never goes past 10 (since we're always decreasing) so the array goes on forever.

\newpage

@. What will the print statements in lines 9 and 17 output? Will it be the same? (You may use a calculator if you want to be exact.) Assume that uninitialized variables in C get assigned garbage values.

  ``` {.c .numberLines}
  void print_sums(void)
  {
    int sum;

    for (int j = 0; j != 10; j++)
    {
      sum = sum + j;
    }
    printf("Sum is %d\n", sum);
    printf("Resetting...\n");

    sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j != 10; j++)
    {
      sum = sum + j;
    }
    printf("Sum is now %d\n", sum);
  }
  ```

  **Answer**: Both loops are doing the same thing, but `sum` is not initialized (only declared) in line 3, so it has *bleh* inside of it. Because of this only the second print is going to be correct saying that "Sum is now 45".

\newpage

@. Rewrite the following code to make an equivalent program that uses a for loop, rather than this while loop.

  ``` c
  int number = 5;
  while (number < 500)
  {
    printf("number = %d\n", number);
    number++;
  }
  ```

  **Answer:**

  ``` c
  for (int number = 5; number < 500; number++)
  {
    printf("number = %d\n", number);
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. Rewrite the following code to make an equivalent program that uses a while loop, rather than this for loop.

  ``` c
  int items;
  int item_cost = 5;
  int remaining_dollars = 50;

  printf("You have $%d. Let's see how many items you can buy!\n", remaining_dollars);

  for (items = 0; remaining_dollars >= item_cost; items++)
  {
    remaining_dollars -= item_cost;
  }

  printf("You bought a total of %d items with your money!\n", items);
  ```

  **Answer:**

  ``` c
  int items = 0;
  int item_cost = 5;
  int remaining_dollars = 50;

  printf("You have $%d. Let's see how many items you can buy!\n", remaining_dollars);

  while (remaining_dollars >= item_cost)
  {
    remaining_dollars -= item_cost;
    items++;
  }

  printf("You bought a total of %d items with your money!\n", items);
  ```

\newpage

@. Is there a difference between the output of these two loops? If so, what is it?

  ``` c
  int x;

  // Loop 1
  x = 0;
  while (x < 10)
  {
    printf("%d\n", x);
    x++;
  }

  // Loop 2
  x = 0;
  do
  {
    printf("%d\n", x);
    x++;
  } while (x < 10);
  ```

**Answer:** This is a trick question! There is no difference in output between these two loops. Both of them will print the following:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

(For another challenge, in what cases would a while loop differ from a do-while loop? Are they interchangeable, or is one sometimes more appropriate than the other?)

\newpage

@. Fill in the blanks to end the loop if `sum > 200`.

  **Answer:**

  ``` c
  int sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    if (sum > 200)
    {
      break;
    }

    sum += i;
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. What would be printed if the following program runs?

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    printf("We are starting the loop!\n");

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
      if (i == 3)
      {
        return 0;
      }

      printf("i = %d\n", i);
    }

    printf("We are ending the loop!\n");

    return 0;
  }
  ```

  **Answer:**

  ```
  We are starting the loop!
  i = 0
  i = 1
  i = 2
  ```

  In this program, the first `printf()` statement is executed. Then the for loop begins, printing the statements `i = 0`, `i = 1`, and `i = 2`. Once `i` becomes 3, the condition in the if statement becomes true. Because of this, `return 0;` is executed, which ends the `main()` function. Consequently, the program finishes without any additional `printf()` statements.

\newpage

@. What would be the **return value** of `loopy_loop()` if executed?

  ``` c
  int loopy_loop(void)
  {
    int x = 0;

    while (x < 10)
    {
      printf("x = %d\n", x);

      if (x == 5)
      {
        return 2;
      }

      x += 2;
    }

    return 5;
  }
  ```

  **Answer:** 5

  Notice that as this while loop is running, `x` will be set to every even number between 0 and 9. Because of this, the conditional statement `x == 5` will never be true in the loop, and the `return 2;` statement will never be executed. Once the loop finishes, `loopy_loop()` will return 5.

\newpage

@. Write a program that finds the sum of all integers that a user types in, then when the user types 0, the final sum will be displayed and the program ends. The following is an example of running the program:

  ```
  5
  10
  4
  -9
  0
  The sum is: 10
  ```

  **Sample Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    int sum = 0;
    int n;

    do
    {
      scanf("%d", &n);
      sum += n;
    } while (n != 0);

    printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. Write a program that prints an `n` by `n` "addition table." An addition table is like a multiplication table, except the row and column numbers are added instead of being multiplied. For example, the following is a 5x5 addition table.

  ```
  0   1   2   3   4
  1   2   3   4   5
  2   3   4   5   6
  3   4   5   6   7
  4   5   6   7   8
  ```

  **Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    // n can be set to any value, or even be collected through user input.
    int n = 5;

    // This uses two loops, the outer loop iterates row-by-row, and the
    // inner loop iterates across an individual row.
    for (int row = 0; row < n; row++)
    {
      for (int col = 0; col < n; col++)
      {
        // Here, we just print the sum of the current row and column number.
        // The 5 in %5d helps align all of the numbers.
        printf("%5d", row + col);
      }
      // At the end of each row, print a new line, visually starting the next row.
      printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
  }
  ```

\newpage

@. **Challenge:** Write a program that prints a diamond shape with a height of `n`. Assume that `n` is greater than 2 and is odd. As an example, the following is a diamond with a height of 5.

  ```
    #
   # #
  #   #
   # #
    #
  ```

  **Sample Answer:**

  ``` c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    // Break down into 3 sections per row: the space outside the diamond, the #'s
    // making up the diamond, and the space inside the diamond

    int n = 5;
    int outer_spaces, inner_spaces;

    for (int row = 0; row < n; row++)
    {
      // Calculate number of outer spaces
      if (row <= n / 2)
        outer_spaces = (n / 2) - row;
      else
        outer_spaces = row - (n / 2);

      // Print outer spaces
      for (int i = 0; i < outer_spaces; i++)
      {
        printf(" ");
      }

      // Print left side of diamond
      printf("#");

      // Calculate number of inner spaces
      if (row <= n / 2)
        inner_spaces = (2 * (row - 1)) + 1;
      else
        inner_spaces = (2 * (n - row - 2)) + 1;

      // Print inner spaces
      for (int i = 0; i < inner_spaces; i++)
      {
        printf(" ");
      }

      // Print right side of diamond (if not the top or bottom)
      if (row != 0 && row != n - 1)
      {
        printf("#");
      }

      // End the row
      printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
  }
  ```
