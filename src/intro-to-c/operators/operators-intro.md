## Arithmetic Operators

An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations, the ones we learn in elementary school.

- **`+`** : addition
- **`-`** : subtraction
- **`*`** : multiplication
- **`/`** : division
- **`%`** : modulus, remainder after division
- **`++`** : increment, increases the value by one
	- If it is at the front of an operand, it applies a pre-increment.
	- If it is at the end of an operand, it applies a post-increment.
- **`--`** : decrement, decreases the value by one
	- If it is at the front of an operand, it applies a pre-decrement.
	- If it is at the end of an operand, it applies a post-decrement.

A note on pre- and post- operations: a pre-increment or pre-decrement will update the operand's value *before* using the value in an expression. A post-increment or post-decrement will update the operand's value *after* using the current value in an expression.

Let's look at a coding example!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 11,b = 3, c;

    printf("If a = %d and b = %d, then: \n", a,b);
    c = a+b;
    printf("a+b = %d \n",c);
    c = a-b;
    printf("a-b = %d \n",c);
    c = a*b;
    printf("a*b = %d \n",c);
    c = a/b;
    printf("a/b = %d \n",c);
    c = a%b;
    printf("Remainder when a is divided by b = %d \n",c);

    return 0;
}
```

The output of this program will be:

```
If a = 11 and b = 3, then:
a+b = 14
a-b = 8
a*b = 33
a/b = 3
Remainder when a is divided by b = 2
```

Note: if you divide 11 by 3 on a calculator, the result will be 3.6666, but since we are working with integers, only 3 is printed.

Let's look at an increment example separately as it can be a little tricky.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 5;
    printf("a = %d \n", a);
    int b = ++a; // first 'a' becomes 6 and then stored in 'b'. Pre-increment.
    printf("b = %d \n", b);
    int c = a++; // first 'a' i.e. 6 is stored in 'c' then 'a' becomes 7. Post-increment.
    printf("c = %d \n", c);
    int d = a; // a is now 7 in memory slot d.
    printf("d = %d \n", d);
    printf("a = %d \n", a);

    return 0;
}
```

The output will be:

```
a = 5
b = 6
c = 6
d = 7
a = 7
```

## Assignment Operators

An assignment operator will assign (shocking! I know) a value to a variable.

- **`=`** : simply assign. B = A
- **`+=`** : adds and assigns. B += A is the same as B = B+A
- **`-=`** : subtracts and assigns. B -= A is the same as B = B - A
- **`*=`** : multiplies and assigns. B *= A is the same as B = B * A
- **`/=`** : divides and assigns. B /= A is the same as B = B / A
- **`%=`** :  takes the modulus and assigns. B %= A is the same as B = B % A

Let's look at an example!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 5, c;

    c = a;      // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c += a;     // c is 10
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c -= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c *= a;     // c is 25
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c /= a;     // c is 5
    printf("c = %d\n", c);
    c %= a;     // c = 0
    printf("c = %d\n", c);

    return 0;
}
```

The output will be:

```
c = 5
c = 10
c = 5
c = 25
c = 5
c = 0
```

## Relational Operators

A relational operator will check the relationship of two values. If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it returns value 0.

- **`==`** : equal to. If the values are equal, it returns 1.
- **`!=`** : not equal to. If the values are NOT equal, it returns 1.
- **`>`** : greater than. If the left value is greater than the right value, it returns 1.
- **`<`** : less than. If the left value is less than the right value, it returns 1.
- **`>=`** : greater than or equal to. If the left value is greater than or equal to the right value, it returns 1.
- **`<=`** : less than or equal to. If the left value is less than or equal to the right value, it returns 1.

Let's take a look at a coding example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 3, b = 3, c = 7;

    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, b, a == b);
    printf("%d == %d is %d \n", a, c, a == c);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, b, a != b);
    printf("%d != %d is %d \n", a, c, a != c);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, b, a > b);
    printf("%d > %d is %d \n", a, c, a > c);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, b, a < b);
    printf("%d < %d is %d \n", a, c, a < c);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, b, a >= b);
    printf("%d >= %d is %d \n", a, c, a >= c);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, b, a <= b);
    printf("%d <= %d is %d \n", a, c, a <= c);

    return 0;
}
```

The output is:

```
3 == 3 is 1
3 == 7 is 0
3 != 3 is 0
3 != 7 is 1
3 > 3 is 0
3 > 7 is 0
3 < 3 is 0
3 < 7 is 1
3 >= 3 is 1
3 >= 7 is 0
3 <= 3 is 1
3 <= 7 is 1
```

Remember: 1 is true, 0 is false.

## Logical Operators

A logical operator connects two or more expressions and returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether the compound expression results true or false.

- **`&&`** : Logical AND, it is true only if all operands are true
- **`||`** : Logical OR, it is true if either one operand is true
- **`!`** : Logical NOT, it is used to reverse the logical state. If a condition is true, then NOT will make it false.

Let's look at an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 3, b = 3, c = 7, result;

    result = (a == b) && (c > b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c > b) is %d \n", result);

    result = (a == b) && (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) && (c < b) is %d \n", result);

    result = (a == b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a == b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);

    result = (a != b) || (c < b);
    printf("(a != b) || (c < b) is %d \n", result);

    result = !(a != b);
    printf("!(a != b) is %d \n", result);

    result = !(a == b);
    printf("!(a == b) is %d \n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

The output is

```
(a == b) && (c > b) is 1 // both expressions are true, so the compound expression is true
(a == b) && (c < b) is 0 // the first expression is true but the second is not, so the compound expression is false
(a == b) || (c < b) is 1 // the first expression is true, so the compound expression is true
(a != b) || (c < b) is 0 // both expressions are false, so the compound expression is false
!(a != b) is 1 // a != b will return 0 but since we have the !, then !0 is 1
!(a == b) is 0 // a == b will return 1 but since we have the !, then !1 = 0
```


## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform bit-level operations. This is not used in intro to C, but it will be a good reference for the future.

- **`&`** : Bitwise AND; copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands
- **`|`** : Bitwise OR; copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
- **`^`** : Bitwise XOR; short for "e**x**clusive **or**", copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
- **`~`** : Bitwise NOT; inverts all the bits from one operand.
- **`<<`** : Bitwise shift left; takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
- **`>>`** : Bitwise shift right; takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

So to understand this example, I recommend you have a binary converter opened, such as [this one](https://bitwisecmd.com/#help)!

Let's suppose we have two numbers, a which is equal to 60 and b which is equal to 13. If we convert them to binary, we have that:

```
a = 0011 1100
b = 0000 1101
```

So what these bitwise operators will do is analyze each bit, return 0 or 1 and by doing that to all the 8 bits, we will have a new binary number.

For example:

### `a&b`

```
a   = 0011 1100
b   = 0000 1101
---------------
a&b = 0000 1100
```
For `a&b`, a AND b must be 1 to return 1, if not it returns 0. Let's expand this bit by bit to further understand.

```
a's first bit   = 0
b's first bit   = 0
a&b's first bit = ?
```

Both are 0, so the first bit of `a&b` will be `0`.
Onto the next bit:

```
a's second bit   = 0
b's second bit   = 0
a&b's second bit = ?
```

Again both are 0, so the second bit of `a&b` will be `0`.

```
a's third bit   = 1
b's third bit   = 0
a&b's third bit = ?
```

In this case, a is 1 and b is 0. The third bit of `a&b` will still be `0`.

```
a's forth bit   = 1
b's forth bit   = 0
a&b's forth bit = ?
```

Again, a is 1 and b is 0. The forth bit of `a&b` will still be `0`.
Therefore, so far for `a&b` we have:

```
a&b = 0000
```

Now let's move to the fifth bit

```
a's fifth bit   = 1
b's fifth bit   = 1
a&b's fifth bit = ?
```

Yay! a and b are finally both 1! So for the fifth bit of `a&b` we will have a `1`!

```
a's sixth bit   = 1
b's sixth bit   = 1
a&b's sixth bit = ?
```

And we have another `1` for `a&b` since a and b are 1's. We are almost there!

```
a's seventh bit   = 0
b's seventh bit   = 0
a&b's seventh bit = ?
```

Both are 0, so the seventh bit of `a&b` will be `0`.
Last move to the last bit:

```
a's eighth bit   = 0
b's eighth bit   = 1
a&b's eighth bit = ?
```

Here a is 0 and b is 1, so the last bit of `a&b` will be a `0`.

And our final result is:

```
a&b = 0000 1100
```

If we convert `a&b` to decimal, we will have 12, which it might be odd if you just look at it as decimals, that is why you need to convert to binary.

### `a|b`

```
a   = 0011 1100
b   = 0000 1101
---------------
a|b = 0011 1101 // a OR b must be 1 to return 1, if not it returns 0
```

Converting that will return 61.

### `a^b`

```
a   = 0011 1100
b   = 0000 1101
---------------
a^b = 0011 0001 // only a OR b must be 1 to return 1. if both are true/false, then it returns 0
```

Converting to decimal will return 49.

### `~a`

```
a   = 0011 1100
---------------
~a  = 1100 0011 // inverts the bits
```

Converting to decimal will return -61 because the first bit is 1, so the number is negative.

### `a << 2`

```
a      = 0011 1100
------------------
a << 2 = 1111 0000 // moved the 2 first bits to the end
```

Converting to decimal will return 240.

### `a << 2`

```
a      = 0011 1100
------------------
a << 2 = 0000 1111 // moved the 2 last bits to the front
```

Converting to decimal will return 15.

And here's in code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 60, b = 13;

    printf("%d \n", a&b);
    printf("%d \n", a|b);
    printf("%d \n", a^b);
    printf("%d \n", ~a);
    printf("%d \n", a << 2);
    printf("%d \n", a >> 2);
    return 0;
}
```

The output is:

```
12
61
49
-61
240
15
```

The compiler will not show the binaries, it will return the decimal value.
