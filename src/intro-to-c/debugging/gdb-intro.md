title: Introduction to GDB

The GNU Project Debugger, or GDB for short, is a very useful debugging tool. It allows you to see what the values in your program look like at any given point in time, and it lets you temporarily modify those values to see how your program runs in response, acting as if you actually made those changes in your code.

In the example below, a student is working on a program but encounters a segmentation fault (also known as a "segfault"). They're not sure what's causing it, but thanks to GDB, they can see what's going on "under the hood" of their program and try to solve the problem.

## Case Study: A Pointer Program

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

void multiply_by_two(int *current, int *arr);

int main(void)
{
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *current = arr;
    int i = 0;

    printf("Before\n");
    printf("------\n");

    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, *current);
        current++;
    }

    current = NULL;
    multiply_by_two(current, arr);

    printf("\nAfter\n");
    printf("-----\n");

    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, *current);
        current++;
    }

    printf("\nAll done!\n");

    return 0;
}

void multiply_by_two(int *current, int *arr)
{
    int i = 0;
    current = arr;

    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        *current = *current * 2;
        current++;
    }

    current = arr;
}

```

Okay, everything looks alright. Time to compile.

``` {.terminal}
my-pc:~intro-to-c/assignments/pointers$ gcc my_file.c
my-pc:~intro-to-c/assignments/pointers$
```

Yes, no warnings! Okay, now let me run it.

``` {.terminal}
my-pc:~intro-to-c/assignments/pointers$ ./a.out
Before
------
arr[0] = 10
arr[1] = 20
arr[2] = 30
arr[3] = 40
arr[4] = 50

After
-----
Segmentation fault
```

No, not a segfault! This can't be possible--my code is *perfect*! Fine, I guess I'll just have to debug it. Time to start typing up print statements... or maybe I can try that debugger I've been reading about. What is it called again? Oh, yeah, GDB.

## Compiling for Debugging

Alright, first I have to recompile my code with the `-g` flag.

``` {.terminal}
my-pc:~intro-to-c/assignments/pointers$ gcc -g my_file.c
my-pc:~intro-to-c/assignments/pointers$
```

> Using the `-g` flag adds debugging information to your compiled file. Alternatively, you could use the `-ggdb` flag, which adds debugging information specifically meant for GDB (e.g., `gcc -ggdb my_file.c`).

## Entering GDB

Now I need to pass GDB the program's name, and in I go.

``` {.terminal}

## Finding the Problem

Let me run the program and see where it's stopping.

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/my-pc/intro-to-c/assignments/pointers/a.out
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
Before
------
arr[0] = 10
arr[1] = 20
arr[2] = 30
arr[3] = 40
arr[4] = 50

After
-----

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x000055555555527c in main () at my_file.c:28
28              printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, *current);
(gdb)
```

> The `run` command runs your program as if it were running normally in the terminal. Here, we see that the program stopped on the same segmentation fault from earlier.

Hmm, what do the variables look like when I print them?

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) print i
$1 = 0
(gdb) print &arr
$2 = (int (*)[5]) 0x7fffffffdfe0
(gdb) print current
$3 = (int *) 0x0
(gdb)
```

> The `print` command can print specific values to the screen. You can use it to get an idea of what your program looked like when it stopped.

Okay, since `i` is 0, that means the segfault happened on my first time through the loop. I can also see that `current` *clearly* isn't pointing to `arr`'s address.

In fact, the address in `current` is `NULL`, so it looks like I dereferenced a `NULL` pointer. I'll continue and see if anything else pops up.

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
The program no longer exists.
(gdb)
```

> The `continue` command lets your program continue running as it normally would. The program will still stop on any breakpoints, a concept we will look at next.

## Forming a Hypothesis

Alright, so the problem is happening *before* the second for loop, but where? I'll set a breakpoint at the top of `main()` so I can move through the program and try to figure it out.

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x555555555195: file my_file.c, line 6.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/my-pc/intro-to-c/assignments/pointers/a.out
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".

Breakpoint 1, main () at my_file.c:6
6       {
(gdb)
```

> The `break` command lets you set breakpoints, specific points where you want your program to stop while it's running. A breakpoint gives you a location from which you can choose how and where you want to proceed, whether line-by-line or multiples lines at a time.

> Here, we pass `break` a function name as an argument, but you can also pass it a line number (e.g., `break 6`). If you wanted to be more specific, you could pass it a location written as a file name, colon, and either a function name or a line number (e.g., `break my_file.c:main`, `break my_file.c:6`).

> To see all of your current breakpoints, run `info break`.

> To delete specific breakpoints, run `delete [breakpoint_number_or_range]` (e.g., `delete 1`, `delete 2 3`, `delete 4-7`). To delete all breakpoints, type `delete` with no arguments.

Let me list out a couple of lines to see where I should go.

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) list
1       #include <stdio.h>
2
3       void multiply_by_two(int *current, int *arr);
4
5       int main(void)
6       {
7           int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
8           int *current = arr;
9           int i = 0;
10
(gdb) list
11          printf("Before\n");
12          printf("------\n");
13
14          for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
15          {
16              printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, *current);
17              current++;
18          }
19
20          current = NULL;
(gdb) list
21          multiply_by_two(current, arr);
22
23          printf("\nAfter\n");
24          printf("-----\n");
25
26          for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
27          {
28              printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, *current);
29              current++;
30          }
(gdb)
```

> The `list` command prints, by default, ten lines of a file to the screen, centered around the line currently you're on. You can run `list -` to print ten lines before the lines you just printed. (If you didn't run `list` yet, then `list -` would start off by printing the same ten lines as `list`.)

> Tip: If you ever want to run a command you just used, such as `list`, instead of typing it out again, you can simply press your Enter key.

That looks like enough. Since the first loop works, maybe something is happening in the `multiply_by_two()` function. I'll skip ahead to that line and step into the function.

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) until 21
Before
------
arr[0] = 10
arr[1] = 20
arr[2] = 30
arr[3] = 40
arr[4] = 50
main () at my_file.c:21
21          multiply_by_two(current, arr);
(gdb) step
multiply_by_two (current=0x0, arr=0x7fffffffdfe0) at my_file.c:39
39          int i = 0;
(gdb)
```

> The `until` command lets you continue running your program until you reach a certain line. The program will still stop on any breakpoints.

> The `step` command lets you enter into a function call. If you wanted to continue past a function call, you could run the `next` command instead.

Let me list out some lines like before to get an overview.

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) list
34          return 0;
35      }
36
37      void multiply_by_two(int *current, int *arr)
38      {
39          int i = 0;
40          current = arr;
41
42          for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
43          {
(gdb) list
44              *current = *current * 2;
45              current++;
46          }
47
48          current = arr;
49      }
(gdb)
```

Okay, that's the whole function. `current` starts off pointing to `NULL`, then I set it to point to `arr` just before I leave the function. Shouldn't the `current` in `main()` be pointing to `arr`, too?

Wait a minute... I learned about this! The `current` variable *here* is local to *this* function's scope. That means I actually need to set `current` to point to `arr` in the `main()` function!

## Testing the Hypothesis

Let me finish this function to see if I'm right.

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) finish
Run till exit from #0  multiply_by_two (current=0x0, arr=0x7fffffffdfe0) at my_file.c:39
main () at my_file.c:23
23          printf("\nAfter\n");
(gdb) print current = arr
$4 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdfe0
(gdb) print current
$5 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdfe0
(gdb) print &arr
$6 = (int (*)[5]) 0x7fffffffdfe0
(gdb)
```

> The `finish` command tells your program to continue running until the function exits. The program will still stop on any breakpoints.

> As we saw in the above block with the `print current = arr` line, the `print` command can be used to not only *display* values but to also *change* values. Here, we passed it an assignment expression to change the value held in `current`. If you did something like this while debugging, then once your program started running again, it would run as if that change had *actually* been made in your code.

Okay, now I set `current` to point to `arr`, and I can see that the addresses match. Will it work this time?

``` {.terminal}
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

After
-----
arr[0] = 20
arr[1] = 40
arr[2] = 60
arr[3] = 80
arr[4] = 100

All done!
[Inferior 1 (process 620) exited normally]
(gdb)
```

> Here, we come to end of the program again, but this time, there is no segmentation fault because we changed the value held in `current`. **However, any changes you make using `print` are temporary, lasting only for the duration of that specific program run. Permanent changes need to actually be edited into your code**, as you will see below.

## Making the Changes

Yes, it worked! Let me quit GDB and edit my code so I can see it if it *really*, really works.

```  {.terminal}
(gdb) quit
```

> The `quit` command lets you exit GDB. You can also use `exit` instead of `quit`.

``` c
    // In the text editor.
	
    // In the main() function.
    ...
    current = NULL;
    multiply_by_two(current, arr);
    
    // Adding this line!
    current = arr; 

    printf("\nAfter\n");
    printf("-----\n");
    ...
	
    // In the multiply_by_two() function.
    ...
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        *current = *current * 2;
        current++;
    }
	
    // Deleting this line!
    // current = arr;
}
	
```

``` {.terminal}
my-pc:~intro-to-c/assignments/pointers$ gcc my_file.c
my-pc:~intro-to-c/assignments/pointers$ ./a.out
Before
------
arr[0] = 10
arr[1] = 20
arr[2] = 30
arr[3] = 40
arr[4] = 50

After
-----
arr[0] = 20
arr[1] = 40
arr[2] = 60
arr[3] = 80
arr[4] = 100

All done!
```

Yes, it *really*, really worked! I knew I could do it!
