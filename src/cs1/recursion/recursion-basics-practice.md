@. Given a positive integer `n`, return the sum of the digits of `n`. For example `123` would return `6` because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

Given the function header, write a recursive solution to this problem.

```c
   int sumDigits(int n){
       // You write this
   }
```

@. The Lucas numbers are similar to Fibonacci numbers, you can calculate them based off the previous two calculated numbers. Write a program that calculates the `n'th` Lucas number. Learn more about Lucas numbers [here](https://brilliant.org/wiki/lucas-numbers/).

```c
   int lucas(int n){
      // You write this
   }
```
