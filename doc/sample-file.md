<!-- This document serves as an example to see how files are written in
     markdown. The first thing to note is that HTML-style comments
     (like the one you are in the middle of reading right now) are not
     rendered in the final output, and can be used for leaving comments
     for the sake of development, like remembering spots that may need
     revision later. -->

<!-- This first part here demonstrates a metadata block (in YAML
     syntax), which just indicates the title of the document and its
     author(s). Note that this block is not strictly required, but is
     useful to keep consistency between documents.
     
     By default, a table of contents is added under the title and
     author(s). To disable this for a specific page, add the line
     "toc:false" in the metadata block. -->

---
title: Sample Document
author:
  - Old McDonald
  - Ash Ketchum

<!-- Now it is time to begin your document! Let's start with a heading!
     There are 6 different levels of headings available, with the
     first-level heading being the largest, and the sixth-level heading
     being the smallest. Something important to note is that headings
     must have an empty line before and after them, or there may be
     strange behavior with the surrounding lines of text.-->

# Basic Formatting

<!-- Let's try some basic-ish markdown. Notice that underlined text is
     not native to markdown, but we can still use it with the addition
     of HTML tags! Lists also have an empty line before them to render
     properly in all places. -->

Hello! This is my document! We can have all kinds of styles to use!
Here is a list of some styles, and different ways to write them! See
the source file to find out exactly how it works!

This is a second paragraph.

- **Bold text**
- __Bold text__
- *Italic text*
- _Italic text_
- ***Bold and italic text***
- **_Bold and italic text_**
- __*Bold and italic text*__
- <span class="underline">Underlined text</span>
- ~~Strikethrough text~~

My favorite fruits (best to worst):

1. Bananas
2. Apples
3. Grapes

# Blockquotes

<!-- Blockquotes can be added, even with multiple paragraphs! -->

> Fun fact: "All your base are belong to us" is an Internet meme based
> on a badly translated phrase from the opening cutscene of the video
> game Zero Wing.
>
> \- Wikipedia

<!-- Blockquotes can also be nested! -->

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her
> castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor
>> and keep the fire fed with wood.
>>
>>> Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard
>>> as she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to
>>> kill her.
>>>
>>>> With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the
>>>> courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse.


# Paragraphs in Lists

<!-- What if you want a list with multiple paragraphs on each bullet
     point? To do this, just add four spaces or a tab at the beginning
     of the line. The same rules of starting new paragraphs apply here,
     so new paragraphs will need to have an empty new line before and
     after them. -->

- This is a normal list item.

- This is a list item... but now I will add a second paragraph.

    Notice that this paragraph shows up on the same bullet at the
    previous paragraph!

- Now this is a third bullet, also part of the same list.


# Auto-Numbered Lists

<!-- What if you want to make a list, but then interrupt it with
     something else, then come back to resume the list later? You could
     do this numbering yourself, but this can become more tedious as
     the number of items in the list increases. Featuring auto-numbered
     lists! Instead of beginning the line with the number, begin it
     with @. This indicates an auto-numbered list. -->

@. This is the first item in the list. Notice that in the final output,
this will simply say 1.
@. This is the second item in the list. So far, so good!

Now I will interrupt this list and get back to it in another section!

# Links

<!-- To create a link, use square brackets for the displayed text of
     the link, and parentheses for the link itself. To use the link
     itself as the printed text, use angled brackets. (Some links may
     not work if they don't have "http://" or "https://" at the
     beginning.) -->

Here's how to get to [Google](https://google.com)!

This is another link: <https://ucf.edu>


Here's a horizontal line! 
<!-- (Make sure to put new lines before and after it!) -->

---

<!-- In PDF files, sometimes we want to manually start a new page to
     format contents a certain way. You can use native LaTeX within
     this pandoc flavor of markdown as well! This will be completely
     invisible in HTML outputs, but shows in the formats that have
     pages. -->

\newpage

# Images

<!-- To make an image, this is almost the same as a link, but with an
     exclamation point before it. The text in the square brackets in
     this case will be the alt text. The link to an image may also be a
     relative path from the current markdown file. 
     
     The backslash at the ends of these images are applicable in the
     case of PDF files. When a file is exported to PDF, images are
     turned into "figures" by default. This can be handy if you did
     want them as figures, but the backslash at the end will ensure
     that the image is inline with the rest of the surrounding text
     (removing the figure functionality). -->

# Tables

Examples:

<!-- This is a simple table with minimal formatting. The alignment of
     each column is based on the lines relative to the header text
     above it.  -->

Left                  Right     Center     Default
---------------   ---------   ----------   -------
apples                  456       C        56
watermelons               9      Java      9321
bananas               13713     Python     485

<!-- Tables can also be created using a more grid-like format.
     Alignment is done by colons. -->

| Left              |        Right |   Center   |    Default   |
|:------------------|-------------:|:----------:|--------------|
| Barack Obama      |      Retired |     5      | 2009         |
| Thomas Jefferson  | Very Retired |     10     | 1801         |
| George Washington | Very Retired |     15     | 1789         |
| Joe Biden         |      Current |     20     | 2021         |

<!-- While it's harder to read in Markdown, spacing nor the vertical
     bars at the beginning and end of each line are a requirement. -->

Left|Right|Center|Default
:---|----:|:----:|-------
Barack Obama|Retired|5|2009
Thomas Jefferson|Very Retired|10|1801
George Washington|Very Retired|15|1789
Joe Biden|Current|20|2021

You can also have very fancy tables!

<!-- These "fancy tables" can use any markdown nested inside of them. -->

# Monospaced ("Code Style") Text

<!-- To write monospace text, surround it with one backtick (`). This
     can be helpful when, for example, you want to refer to a coding
     concept in the middle of a paragraph, but in a visually distinct
     style to indicate that you are not necessarily referring to a word
     in the English language. -->

Example:

Today I'm going to tell you about the world of conditions! While you
are working on a `while` loop, make sure to put a condition inside of
the parentheses, or you use a `break` statement to end it! Otherwise
you could end up in an infinite loop! Oh no!


# Math Style Text

<!-- To write mathematical expressions, surround them with dollar
     signs ($). Anything available in TeX math mode is available
     here. -->

Examples:

What is the value of $x^2$ if $x$ is 5?

<!-- Surrounding a mathematical expression with two dollar signs will
     separate it on its own line. -->

Solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Solve the following:

$$\int_{0}^{\infty}{ln^2(\frac{x^2}{x^2+3x+2})dx}$$


# Code Blocks

<!-- Sometimes, you want to be able to show code, console output, and
     more, with even syntax highlighting and all that. It's pretty
     easy! Simply surround it with three backticks (```). -->

```
This is some text that will show up exactly the way you write it!
I can even make ASCII art here!

 O    - "ay yo"
/|\
/ \
```

<!-- To write a code block with syntax highlighting, simply put the
     name of the language after the three backticks. -->

C code with syntax highlighting:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

<!-- Pandoc has a special attribute class (.numberLines) that allows us
     to add line numbers to the beginning of each line! This can be
     especially handy when you want to point to a specific line of code
     within a block. Notice that class attributes are written within
     curly braces, and each attribute class begins with a dot. -->

Code block with line numbers:

``` {.numberLines}
This block of text
Has
Numbers!

  O     - "neat"
--|--
 / \
```

<!-- It's no problem to even stack attributes together! -->

C code with syntax highlighting and line numbers:

``` {.c .numberLines}
int fib(int n)
{
  if (n < 0) return 0;
  if (n < 2) return n;

  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

<!-- We have also added a custom "terminal" attribute, which can be
     referred to with .terminal, .console, or .command-line. Any of
     them works! This is ideal for situations where you want to show
     the terminal output to some code in a visually distinct form. -->

"Terminal style" code block:

``` {.terminal}

```

# Auto-Numbered Lists (Continued)

We're back to that auto-numbered list! Let's pick up where we left off:

@. This is the next item of the list. (It should say it is the third item!)
@. Finally, this is the last item of the list. Oh no, it's over so soon!
